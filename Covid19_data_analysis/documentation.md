# Covid-19 Deaths Data Analysis

We are going to study some available data about Covid-19 deaths and cases. The main idea of this project is to build an SQL database and carry out some (hopefully) interesting queries.

### What's in here?
First of all there are two branches: `main` and `files`. In the first branch you can find
- Some of the queries we carried out in `queries.sql`
- Some of the queries we used to produce the visualizations (see below) in `queries_for_tableau.sql`
In the second branch you can find
- The two sub-tables of the dataset used to build the SQL database in zipped format `CovidDeaths.zip` and `CovidVaccinations.zip`
- Some of the tables in xls format used to carry out some visualizations  (see below)

### Dataset 
The data we used where made available by *our world in data*, see https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. In the files branch of this repository there are  the tables we used to populate the SQL database we used and to produce some visualizations.

### There are some visualizations available!

to see the `Tableau Dashboards` associated to this project. 

### There is an interesting article related to this topic
The group R2D3 has done a remarkable job in explaining Covid-19 simulations, and I feel like the following article is relevant and worth to read to make bettere sense out of the work carried out in this repository: http://www.r2d3.us/covid-19/.

### Disclamair
This project was part of a bigger project I worked on with Unilab. I couldn't provide here all the results we obtained, but I've tryied to show here some important intermediate steps which I think can be valuable on their own.
