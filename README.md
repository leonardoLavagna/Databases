# Databases
Here you can find some projects where I've worked with some databases, mainly using MySQL, MongoDB and Tableaux.

- `Covid19_data_analysis` contains analysis and visualizations about the Covid19 pandemic with a dataset last updated in 2022.
- `Employee_database` contains queries about a toy-employee-database.

Each project in the corresponding folder has its own, more detailed, documentation.
